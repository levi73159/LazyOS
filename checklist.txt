[#] GDT (Global Descriptor Table) set up (32-bit protected mode / 64-bit long mode).
[#] IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table) set up.
[#] PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) set up.
[#] Exception handlers set up.
[#] Basic IRQ handler set up.
[ ] Cpu identification.

IRQS:
[#] Keyboard
[|] Mouse (still got some work to do here)
[-] Timer (PIT / HPET / APIC timer driver)
   [#] PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) set up. 
   [ ] HPET (High Precision Event Timer) set up.
   [ ] APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) set up.

Memory management:
[ ] Physical memory manager.
[ ] Virtual memory manager.


Phase 5: Process + Scheduling
[] Process control block structure.
[] Process control block structure.
[ ] Context switching (save/restore registers, switch page tables).
[ ] Preemptive scheduling with timer IRQ.
[ ] Basic syscall interface (software interrupt/syscall instruction).

Phase 6: Filesystem + Disk I/O

[ ] ATA/IDE or AHCI driver.
[ ] Simple filesystem (FAT12/16/32 is easiest to start with).
[ ] VFS (Virtual File System layer).
[ ] Read/write files from disk.

Phase 7: User Mode

[ ] Switch to ring 3 (user mode).
[ ] Separate page tables for processes.
[ ] Syscall ABI (file I/O, memory management, IPC, etc.).
[ ] Load and run ELF binaries.

Phase 8: Advanced Features (long-term goals)

[ ] SMP (multiprocessor support).
[ ] Dynamic drivers (PCI bus scanning, loading drivers at runtime).
[ ] Networking stack (Ethernet + TCP/IP).
[ ] GUI / graphics driver.
[ ] Userspace libraries.
